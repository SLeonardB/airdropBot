# Telegram Airdrop Bot Version 1
  _At an Initial Coin Offering(ICO), this code can create a telegram bot to automate an airdrop giveaway if any to users who are interested in the currency.
  Users register with the bot, receive and verify their FM wallet and refer at least one more user. The referred user should join for the free airdrop to be received by the referer.
  Users receive more airdrops for referring more users if the referred users join before the ICO deadline._

  ## Running the bot
  ### With python and pip installed 
  ```
  $ python -m venv botEnv;
    source botEnv/bin/activate;
    pip install python-telegram-bot;
    python fmbot_v1.py
  ```
  ### Tested on _Linux, Termux_

  ## Any Other Business:
  - The code can be _altered_ to meet particular use cases.

  - Telegram bot username: _@FlowMintDropBot_
  - Email improvements to [_developer_.](https://sleonardb.github.io/home/)
  - This code is for _demonstration_ purposes only therefore no real crypto-currency network has been used.
